#                                             Code Quiz

This is my project where I created a Code Quiz from scratch. The Quiz includes of the criteria such as create the start button, set a timer starts, ask the questions. My page is responsive and styling is according to the demo. At the end you can save your initials aswell. I attempted to save to local-storage and initials but was unable to successfully. I will resubmit after graded.
